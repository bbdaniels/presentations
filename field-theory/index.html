# Introduction

# Who am I?

My name is Benjamin Daniels. I have worked in large-scale field research
on a number of projects over the last ~8 years. This includes classic surveys,
novel measurement methods (standardized patients), impact evaluation,
MLE-type program support, etc.

I am currently a Research Fellow here at _gui<sup>2</sup>de_ at Georgetown.
I moved here in September 2019 from the World Bank,
where I sat in the research department (DEC),
sharing time between DECHD and DIME.

# Why are we talking about **field** research?

I assume you all know impact evaluation _theory_ pretty well inside and out.
It sounds nice and neat when you get it in a classroom format;
the academic works that cover this material also tend to be very "clean".
Some examples:

- Athey/Imbens: https://pubs.aeaweb.org/doi/pdfplus/10.1257/jep.31.2.3
- Abadie/Cattaneo: https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/abs/10.1146/annurev-economics-080217-053402
- Cunningham: https://scunning.com/mixtape.html

Things seem nice and neat when you have these causal models.
However it is almost never neat in practice.
You will often find that a field coordinator is senior to a research assistant...
so think accordingly about your career choices!

# Motivation for this lecture

**Why you should care:**

- Presumably you want to make people's lives better, or something like that
- Research (including intelligently-done evaluation services) is a popular path
- Even if you are not a researcher you will depend on or manage people who are

**If you are a research producer:**

- _Know_ that things are not as clean as in the books
- _Learn_ how to turn close contact with research studies and data into useful insights

**If you are a research consumer:**

- _Know_ that a lot of people are selling you snake oil
- _Learn_ what questions to ask to determine if you are getting high-quality info

---

# What causes these dynamics?

**Who here has been on a field visit?**

- Research studies are an _abstraction layer_.
- People who are doing field research are translating _information_ into _data_
- Implementers (NGOs, govt's, etc.) usually have lots of _information_ but no _data_.

**Close contact with _information_ is needed to transform it to _data_**

- In many cases that is staff: research assistants or field coordinators
- Principals typically do not have the _time_ to learn a study as closely as they need
- Therefore you need to figure out how facts are being systematized or abstracted
- This is the first and most challenging task of a research study

**Never, ever, take data as "given": creating it is _always_ a "social process"!**

The rest of this presentation will talk about some specific steps in this process...

# Handling data ethically

# Handling data ethically

**Think of research as a public service**

- You are accountable to research _participants_ and research _consumers_
- Typically, some people are asking you to study the lives of some other people
- The people whose lives are being studied can _consent_ to letting you observe them,
and they typically do so in trust that their information is used securely for the public good

**Protect confidence in your work and in research in general**

- Three key tools: _reproducibility_, _transparency_, and _credibility_
- Reproducibility: make code and data as public as possible, and let people access it
- Transparency: prepare and release detailed documentation of your work
- Credibility: show your work so people can evaluate the quality of your design and data collection

---

# Privacy and security

**Handling personally-identifying information is common**

- Research data that directly identifies participants is highly sensitive
- It is governed by US federal law and has serious consequences for mishandling
- Partners in the field (non-researchers especially) do not face the same regulation

**You need to be a leader in proper handling of data**

- IRB review and approval of processes is essential (messing this up is not fun...)
- Ensure that you have secure storage and transfer processes (Box makes this easy)
- Don't handle data you don't need, and create masked copies as soon as you can

**This also means ensuring that you are _personally_ protected:**

- Get yourself a _two-factor authentication_ program and enable it on all accounts (Google Authenticator, Authy, Lastpass)
- Get yourself a _password manager_ so you can create secure passwords and share them with others (BitWarden, LastPass)

# Collaborating on
# code and data

# Collaborating on code

**It is less and less common that work is done by one person alone in a room**

- We have greatly advanced technology; it is not always wise to use it
- More important than being fancy is being able to work with others
- This especially includes others who have different skill sets than you

**The new world is a world of standardization and collaboration**

- _Workflows_ are the most important technology we have
- Everyone on your team should know what and how to make their contributions
- There are lots of work streams out there where you don't need to re-invent the wheel!

# Workflows to steal

**File sharing: three types**

- _Sync_: Everyone has the same files all the time
- _Version Control_: Not everyone has the same files all the time
- _Server Share_: There is only one file, everyone can access it

**Documentation and decision-making**

- Kanban boards or Glo Timelines: Good for project planning
- GitHub Issues: Good for technical and code documentation
- Dropbox Paper: Good for management/organization

**Matching the method to the task is 95% of the challenge.**

- Changing methods is hard further down the road
- Changing organization is even harder...
- Standardize as best as possible and improve project-by-project

# `ietoolkit`: commands for impact evaluations

**Key idea: institutional memory in code**

- Collectively DIME has a lot of experience, and DIME Analytics tasks often boil down to: "generate and disseminate institutional memory"
- [DIME Wiki](https://dimewiki.worldbank.org) and [our book](https://worldbank.github.io/d4di/) are important resources for institutional memory
- But what if we also build institutional memory into the **code** RAs use?
- This is the objective of `ietoolkit` (and `iefieldkit`)

**Resources**

- [Blogpost](https://blogs.worldbank.org/impactevaluations/ie-analytics-introducing-ietoolkit)
- [Homepage](https://worldbank.github.io/ietoolkit/)

# Showcase: `iefolder`

- This is the flagship command for the suite. It sets up the `DataWork` folder, a standardized project folder structure for reproducible research.
- In addition to setting up the `DataWork` folder, iefolder creates master do-files linking to all main folders in the folder structure.
- These master do-files are updated whenever more rounds, units of observations, and subfolders are added to the project folder using this command.

# `iefieldkit`: commands for data collection

**Key idea: move human tasks out of code**

- Data collection is a process that has traditionally suffered from low levels of documentation, standardization, and replicability
- These commands automatically output human- _and_ machine-readable spreadsheet documentation as a functional part of the intended workflow
- Example of using Stata to bring ideals of standardization and replicability to one of our core tasks that is usually considered less technical

# Showcase: `iecodebook`

- Anyone can write thousands of `rename`, `recode`, and `label` commands.
- Nobody wants to, and it is very hard to find errors later.
- `iecodebook` enables this to be done for one or more datasets at a time,
including making sure value labels harmonize across appending multiple rounds.
- **Most importantly**, this is all done in a spreadsheet that anyone can read!

In Stata, then, one line:
```
iecodebook append "survey1.dta" "survey2.dta" using "codebook.xlsx"
```
